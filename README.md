# E-commerce-Sales-Analysis-and-Data-Visualization
In this project, I assumed the role of a Data Analyst for a hypothetical e-commerce company, Daily Life Essentials, with the objective of analyzing its financial and sales performance. I was tasked with conducting a comprehensive yet concise analysis of sales data from 2023 to 2025 and building an interactive Power BI dashboard.

# Company Introduction

Daily Life Essentials is a Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) e-commerce company that specializes in selling a wide range of products across categories such as apparel, fashion, children’s products, and home essentials. Positioned as a one-stop destination for everyday needs, the company has been steadily expanding its customer base and product portfolio to cater to the evolving lifestyle requirements of modern consumers.

# Business Problem

The company has accumulated detailed financial sales data spanning 2023 to 2025. However, the leadership team lacks a consolidated view of key performance metrics such as net revenue, losses incurred, and category-wise performance. Stakeholders are particularly interested in obtaining a concise performance overview of the 2024–2025 period, in order to assess business progress, identify problem areas, and evaluate future opportunities.

# Analytical Task

As a Data Analyst, I have been assigned the responsibility of conducting a comprehensive yet crisp analysis of the available sales data and developing a Power BI dashboard that highlights:

Net revenue trends over the years.

Loss patterns and key contributing factors.

Product category-wise performance insights.

Year-over-year comparisons for 2024 and 2025.

The final deliverable will include a dashboard and a presentation of key insights, designed to provide stakeholders with a quick yet clear understanding of the company’s financial and sales performance for effective decision-making.
