# E-commerce-Sales-Analysis-and-Data-Visualization
In this project, I assumed the role of a Data Analyst for a hypothetical e-commerce company, Daily Life Essentials, with the objective of analyzing its financial and sales performance. I was tasked with conducting a comprehensive yet concise analysis of sales data from 2023 to 2025 and building an interactive Power BI dashboard.The analysis focused on identifying net revenue trends, examining loss patterns and their contributing factors, evaluating product category-wise performance, and performing year-over-year comparisons for 2024 and 2025. The final deliverables included a dashboard and a presentation of key insights, enabling stakeholders to gain a quick, clear, and actionable overview of the company’s financial health and sales performance to support informed decision-making.

# Company Introduction

Daily Life Essentials is a Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) e-commerce company that specializes in selling a wide range of products across categories such as apparel, fashion, children’s products, and home essentials. Positioned as a one-stop destination for everyday needs, the company has been steadily expanding its customer base and product portfolio to cater to the evolving lifestyle requirements of modern consumers.

# Business Problem

The company has accumulated detailed financial sales data spanning 2023 to 2025. However, the leadership team lacks a consolidated view of key performance metrics such as net revenue, losses incurred, and category-wise performance. Stakeholders are particularly interested in obtaining a concise performance overview of the 2024–2025 period, in order to assess business progress, identify problem areas, and evaluate future opportunities.
